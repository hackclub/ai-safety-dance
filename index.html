<p><strong>The AI debate is actually 100 debates in a trenchcoat.</strong></p>
<p>Will artificial intelligence (AI) help us cure all disease, and build a post-scarcity world full of flourishing lives? Or will AI help tyrants surveil and manipulate us further? Are the main risks of AI from accidents, abuse by bad actors, or a rogue AI <em>itself</em> becoming a bad actor? Is this all just hype? Why can AI imitate any artist's style in a minute, yet gets confused drawing more than 3 objects? Why is it hard to make AI robustly serve humane values, or robustly serve <em>any</em> goal? What if an AI learns to be <em>more</em> humane than us? What if an AI learns humanity's <em>inhumanity</em>, our prejudices and cruelty? Are we headed for utopia, dystopia, extinction, a fate <em>worse</em> than extinction, or — the most shocking outcome of all — <em>nothing changes?</em> Also: will an AI take my job?</p>
<p>...and many more questions.</p>
<p>Alas, to understand AI with nuance, we must understand lots of technical detail... but that detail is scattered across hundreds of articles, buried six-feet-deep in jargon.</p>
<p>So, I present to you:</p>

<p><strong>This 3-part series is your one-stop-shop to understand the core ideas of AI &amp; AI Safety* — explained in a friendly, accessible, and slightly opinionated way!</strong></p>
<p>(* Related phrases: AI Risk, AI X-Risk, AI Alignment, AI Ethics, AI Not-Kill-Everyone-ism. There is <em>no</em> consensus on what these phrases do &amp; don't mean, so I'm just using &quot;AI Safety&quot; as a catch-all.)</p>
<p>This series will also have comics starring a Robot Catboy Maid. Like so:</p>
<p><img src="media/intro/Outer_Alignment.png" alt="Comic. Ham the Human tells RCM (Robot Catboy Maid) to &quot;keep this hosue clean&quot;. RCM reasons: What causes the mess? The humans cause the mess! Therefore: GET RID OF THE HUMANS. RCM then yeets Ham out of the house."></p>

<hr>
<h2>💡 The Core Ideas of AI &amp; AI Safety</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the main problems in AI and AI Safety come down to <strong>two core conflicts:</strong></p>
<p><img src="media/intro/Core%20Problems.png" alt="Logic &quot;vs&quot; Intuition, and Problems in the AI &quot;vs&quot; in Humans"></p>
<p>Note: What &quot;Logic&quot; and &quot;Intuition&quot; are will be explained more rigorously in Part One. For now: Logic is step-by-step cognition, like solving math problems. Intuition is all-at-once <em>re</em>cognition, like seeing if a picture is of a cat. &quot;Intuition and Logic&quot; roughly map onto &quot;System 1 and 2&quot; from cognitive science.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> <em>(👈 hover over these footnotes! they expand!)</em></p>
<p>As you can tell by the &quot;scare&quot; &quot;quotes&quot; on <em>&quot;versus&quot;</em>, these divisions ain't really so divided after all...</p>
<p>Here's how these conflicts repeat over this 3-part series:</p>
<h3>Part 1: The past, present, and possible futures</h3>
<p>Skipping over a <em>lot</em> of detail, the history of AI is a tale of <em>Logic vs Intuition:</em></p>
<p><strong>Before 2000: AI was all logic, no intuition.</strong></p>
<p>This was why, in 1997, AI could beat the world champion at chess... yet no AIs could reliably recognize cats in pictures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>(Safety concern: Without intuition, AI can't understand common sense or humane values. Thus, AI might achieve goals in logically-correct but undesirable ways.)</p>
<p><strong>After 2000: AI could do &quot;intuition&quot;, but had very poor logic.</strong></p>
<p>This is why generative AIs (<em>as of current writing, May 2024</em>) can dream up whole landscapes in any artist's style... <a href="#FourObjects">:yet gets confused drawing more than 3 objects</a>. <em>(👈 click this text! it also expands!)</em></p>
<p>(Safety concern: Without logic, we can't verify what's happening in an AI's &quot;intuition&quot;. That intuition could be biased, subtly-but-dangerously wrong, or fail bizarrely in new scenarios.)</p>
<p><strong>Current Day: We <em>still</em> don't know how to unify logic &amp; intuition in AI.</strong></p>
<p>But if/when we do, <em>that</em> would give us the biggest risks &amp; rewards of AI: something that can logically out-plan us, <em>and</em> learn general intuition. That'd be an &quot;AI Einstein&quot;... or an &quot;AI Oppenheimer&quot;.</p>
<p>Summed in a picture:</p>
<p><img src="media/intro/Timeline.png" alt="Timeline of AI. Before the year 2000, mostly &quot;logic&quot;. From 2000 to now, mostly &quot;intuition&quot;. In the future, maybe both?"></p>
<p>So that's &quot;Logic vs Intuition&quot;. As for the other core conflict, &quot;Problems in the AI vs The Humans&quot;, that's one of the big controversies in the field of AI Safety: are our main risks from advanced AI <em>itself</em>, or from <em>humans</em> misusing advanced AI?</p>
<p>(Why not both?)</p>
<h3>Part 2: The problems</h3>
<p><em>The</em> problem of AI Safety is this:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><u><strong>The Value Alignment Problem</strong></u>:<br>
“How can we make AI robustly serve humane values?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NOTE: I wrote <em>humane</em>, with an &quot;e&quot;, not just &quot;human&quot;. A <em>human</em> may or may not be <em>humane</em>. I'm going to harp on this because <em>both</em> advocates &amp; critics of AI Safety keep mixing up the two.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>We can break this problem down by &quot;Problems in Humans vs AI&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u><strong>Humane Values:</strong></u><br>
“What <em>are</em> humane values, anyway?”<br>
(a problem for philosophy &amp; ethics)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><u><strong>The <em>Technical</em> Alignment Problem:</strong></u><br>
“How can we make AI robustly serve <em>any intended goal</em> at all?”<br>
(a problem for computer scientists - surprisingly, still unsolved!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>technical</em> alignment problem, in turn, can be broken down by &quot;Logic vs Intuition&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Problems with AI Logic</u>:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> (&quot;game theory&quot; problems)</p>
<ul>
<li>AIs may accomplish goals in logical but undesirable ways.</li>
<li>Most goals logically lead to the same unsafe sub-goals: &quot;don't let anyone stop me from accomplishing my goal&quot;, &quot;maximize my ability &amp; resources to optimize for that goal&quot;, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Problems with AI Intuition</u>:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> (&quot;deep learning&quot; problems)</p>
<ul>
<li>An AI trained on human data could learn our prejudices.</li>
<li>AI &quot;intuition&quot; isn't understandable or verifiable.</li>
<li>AI &quot;intuition&quot; is fragile, and fails in new scenarios.</li>
<li>AI &quot;intuition&quot; could <em>partly</em> fail, which may be worse: an AI with intact <em>skills</em>, but broken <em>goals</em>, would be an AI that <em>skillfully</em> acts towards corrupted goals.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>(Again, what &quot;logic&quot; and &quot;intuition&quot; are will be more precisely explained later!)</p>
<p>Summed in a picture:</p>
<p><img src="media/intro/Breakdown.png" alt="A diagram breaking down the AI Alignment Problem. &quot;How can we align AI with humane values?&quot; splits into &quot;Technical Alignment&quot; and &quot;Humane Values&quot;. Technical Alignment splits into &quot;AI Logic (game theory)&quot; and &quot;AI Intuition (deep learning)&quot;"></p>
<p>As intuition for how hard these problems are, note that we haven't even solved them <em>for us humans</em> — People follow the letter of the law, not the spirit. People's intuition can be biased, and fail in new circumstances. And none of us are 100% the humane humans we wished we were.</p>
<p>So, if I may be a bit sappy, maybe understanding AI will help us understand ourselves. And just maybe, we can solve the <em>human</em> alignment problem: How do we get <em>humans</em> to robustly serve humane values?</p>
<h3>Part 3: The proposed solutions</h3>
<p>Finally, we can understand some (possible) ways to solve the problems in logic, intuition, AIs, <em>and</em> humans! These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical solutions</li>
<li>Policy/governance solutions</li>
<li>&quot;How 'bout you just shut it down &amp; don't build the torture nexus&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>— and more! Experts disagree on which proposals will work, if any... but it's a good start.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, I can't give a layperson-friendly summary in this Intro, because these solutions won't make sense <em>until</em> you understand the problems, which is what Part 1 &amp; 2 are for. That said, if you want spoilers, <a href="#Part3Details">:click here to see what Part 3 will cover!</a>)</p>

<h2>🤔 (<em>Optional</em> flashcard review!)</h2>
<p>Hey, d'ya ever get this feeling?</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Wow that was a wonderful, insightful thing I just read&quot;</li>
<li>[forgets everything 2 weeks later]</li>
<li>&quot;Oh no&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>To avoid that for <em>this</em> guide, I've included some <em>OPTIONAL</em> interactive flashcards! They use &quot;Spaced Repetition&quot;, an easy-ish, evidence-backed way to &quot;make long-term memory a choice&quot;. (<a href="#SpacedRepetition">:click here to learn more about Spaced Repetition!</a>)</p>
<p>Here: <strong>try the below flashcards, to retain what you just learnt!</strong></p>
<p>(There's an optional sign-up at the end, <em>if</em> you want to save these cards for long-term study. Note: <em>I do not own or control this app</em>, it's third-party. If you'd rather use the open source flashcard app <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/index.html">Anki</a>, <strong>here's <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/341999410">a downloadable Anki deck</a></strong>!)</p>

<h2>🤷🏻‍♀️ Five common misconceptions about AI Safety</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble.
It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.</em>”</p>
<p>~ often attributed to Mark Twain, but it just ain't so<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For better and worse, you've already heard too much about AI. So before we connect <em>new</em> puzzle pieces in your mind, we gotta take out the <em>old</em> pieces that just ain't so.</p>
<p>Thus, if you'll indulge me in a &quot;Top 5&quot; listicle...</p>
<h3>1) No, AI Safety isn't a fringe concern by sci-fi weebs.</h3>
<p><img src="media/intro/crazy.png" alt="RCM in front of a &quot;crazy board&quot; with red thread, thumbtacks, and papers with AI jargon."></p>
<p>AI Safety / AI Risk used to be less mainstream, but now in 2024, the US &amp; UK governments now have AI Safety-specific departments!<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> This resulted from many of <em>the</em> top AI researchers raising alarm bells about it. These folks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geoffrey Hinton<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> and Yoshua Bengio<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup>, co-winners of the 2018 Turing Prize (the &quot;Nobel Prize of Computing&quot;) for their work on deep neural networks, the thing that <em>all</em> the new famous AIs use.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup></li>
<li>Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, the authors of <em>the</em> most-used textbook on Artificial Intelligence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup></li>
<li>Paul Christiano, pioneer of the AI training/safety technique that made ChatGPT possible.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>(To be clear: there <em>are</em> also top AI researchers <em>against</em> fears of AI Risk, such Yann LeCun,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup> co-winner of the 2018 Turing Prize, and chief AI researcher at <s>Facebook</s> Meta. Another notable name is Melanie Mitchell<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup>, a researcher in AI &amp; complexity science.)</p>
<p>I'm aware &quot;look at these experts&quot; is an appeal to authority, but this is <em>only</em> to counter the idea of, &quot;eh, only sci-fi weebs fear AI Risk&quot;. But in the end, appeal to authority/weebs isn't enough; you have to <em>actually understand the dang thing</em>. (Which you <em>are</em> doing, by reading this! So thank you.)</p>
<p>But speaking of sci-fi weebs...</p>
<h3>2) No, AI Risk is <em>NOT</em> about AI becoming &quot;sentient&quot; or &quot;conscious&quot; or gaining a &quot;will to power&quot;.</h3>
<p>Sci-fi authors write sentient AIs because they're writing <em>stories</em>, not technical papers. The philosophical debate on artificial consciousness is fascinating, <em>and irrelevant to AI Safety.</em> Analogy: a nuclear bomb isn't conscious, but it can still be unsafe, no?</p>
<p><img src="media/intro/conscious.png" alt="Left: drawing of a nuke, captioned &quot;not conscious&quot;. Right: drawing of Professor Nuke giving a lecture titled, &quot;Why Murder is Good, Actually.&quot; Captioned, &quot;conscious&quot;."></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the real problems in AI Safety are &quot;boring&quot;: an AI learns the wrong things from its biased training data, it breaks in slightly-new scenarios, it logically accomplishes goals in undesired ways, etc.</p>
<p>But, &quot;boring&quot; doesn't mean <em>not important</em>. The technical details of how to design a safe elevator/airplane/bridge are boring to most laypeople... <em>and also</em> a matter of life-and-death.</p>
<p>(Catastrophic AI Risk doesn't even require &quot;super-human general intelligence&quot;! For example, an AI that's &quot;only&quot; good at designing viruses could help a bio-terrorist organization (like Aum Shinrikyo<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup>) kill millions of people.)</p>
<p>But speaking of killing people...</p>
<h3>3) No, AI Risk isn't <em>necessarily</em> extinction, SkyNet, or nanobots</h3>
<p><img src="media/intro/omnicide.png" alt="A drawing of Microsoft Clippy saying: &quot;It looks like you're trying to commit omnicide. Would you like some help?&quot;"></p>
<p>While most AI researchers <em>do</em> believe advanced AI poses a 5+% risk of &quot;literally everybody dies&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup>, it's <em>very</em> hard to convince folks (especially policymakers) of stuff that's never happened before.</p>
<p>So instead, I'd like to highlight the ways that advanced AI – (especially when it's available to anyone with a high-end computer) – could lead to catastrophes, &quot;merely&quot; by scaling up <em>already-existing</em> bad stuff.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Bio-engineered pandemics</u>: A bio-terrorist cult (like Aum Shinrikyo<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18:1">[18:1]</a></sup>) uses AI (like AlphaFold<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup>) and DNA-printing (which is getting cheaper <em>fast</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup>) to design multiple new super-viruses, and release them simultaneously in major airports around the globe.
<ul>
<li>(Proof of concept: Scientists have <em>already</em> re-built polio from mail-order DNA... two decades ago.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Digital authoritarianism</u>: A tyrant uses AI-enhanced surveillance to hunt down protestors (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-tech-idUSKBN2AB1U2/">already happening</a>), generate individually-targeted propaganda (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080801/generative-ai-boosting-disinformation-and-propaganda-freedom-house/">kind of happening</a>), and autonomous military robots (<a href="https://theconversation.com/us-military-plans-to-unleash-thousands-of-autonomous-war-robots-over-next-two-years-212444">soon-to-be happening</a>)... all to rule with a silicon fist.</li>
<li><u>Cybersecurity Ransom Hell</u>: Cyber-criminals make a computer virus that <em>does its own hacking &amp; re-programming</em>, so it's always one step ahead of human defenses. The result: an unstoppable worldwide bot-net, which holds critical infrastructure ransom, and manipulates top CEOs and politicians to do its bidding.
<ul>
<li>(For context: <em>without</em> AI, hackers have already damaged nuclear power plants,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup> held hospitals ransom<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup> which maybe killed someone,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup> and almost poisoned a town's water supply <em>twice</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup> <em>With</em> AI, deepfakes have been used to swing an election,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup> steal $25 million in a single heist,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup> and target parents for ransom, using the faked voices of their children being kidnapped &amp; crying for help.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup>)</li>
<li>(This is why it's not easy to &quot;just shut down an AI when we notice it going haywire&quot;; as the history of computer security shows, we just <em>suck</em> at noticing problems in general. <a href="#xz">:I cannot over-emphasize how much the modern world is built on an upside-down house of cards.</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above examples are all &quot;humans <em>misuse</em> AI to cause havoc&quot;, but remember advanced AI could do the above <em>by itself</em>, due to &quot;boring&quot; reasons: it's accomplishing a goal in a logical-but-undesirable way, its goals glitch out but its skills remain intact, etc.</p>
<p>(Bonus, <a href="#ConcreteRogueAI">:Some concrete, plausible ways a rogue AI could &quot;escape containment&quot;, or affect the physical world.</a>)</p>
<p>Point is: even if one doesn't think AI is a <em>literal 100% human extinction</em> risk... I'd say &quot;homebrew bio-terrorism&quot; &amp; &quot;1984 with robots&quot; are still worth taking seriously.</p>
<p>On the flipside...</p>
<h3>4) <em>Yes</em>, folks worried about AI's downsides <em>do</em> recognize its upsides.</h3>
<p><img src="media/intro/parachute.png" alt="Comic. Sheriff Meowdy holds up a blueprint for a parachute design. Ham the Human retorts, annoyed: “Why are you so anti-aviation?”"></p>
<p>AI Risk folks aren't Luddites. In fact, they warn about AI's downsides <em>precisely because</em> they care about AI's upsides.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup> As humorist Gil Stern once said:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Both the optimist and the pessimist contribute to society: the optimist invents the airplane, and the pessimist invents the parachute.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So: even as this series goes into detail on how AI <em>is already</em> going wrong, it's worth remembering the few ways AI <em>is already</em> going right:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI can analyze medical scans <em>as well or better than human specialists!</em> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup> That's concretely life-saving!</li>
<li>AlphaFold basically <em>solved</em> a 50-year-old, major problem in biology: how to predict the shape of proteins.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20:1">[20:1]</a></sup> (AlphaFold can predict a protein's shape to within <em>the width of an atom</em>!) This has huge applications to medicine &amp; understanding disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>Too often, we take technology — even life-saving technology — for granted. So, let me zoom out for context. Here's the last 2000+ years of child mortality, the percentage of kids who die before puberty:</p>
<p><img src="media/intro/owid.jpg" alt="Chart of child mortality over the last 2000+ years. Worldwide, it was constant at around 48%, from hunter-gatherer times to 1800. Then suddenly, starting 1800, it plummets to 4.3% today."><em>(from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality">Dattani, Spooner, Ritchie and Roser (2023)</a>)</em></p>
<p>For <em>thousands</em> of years, in nations both rich and poor, a full <em>half</em> of kids just died. This was a constant. Then, starting in the 1800s — thanks to science/tech like germ theory, sanitation, medicine, clean water, vaccines, etc — child mortality fell off like a cliff. We still have far more to go — I refuse to accept<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup> a worldwide 4.3% (1 in 23) child death rate — but let's just appreciate how humanity <em>so swiftly cut down</em> an <em>eons-old</em> scourge.</p>
<p>How did we achieve this? Policy's a big part of the story, but policy is &quot;the art of the possible&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup>, and the above wouldn't have been possible without <em>good</em> science &amp; tech. If safe, humane AI can help us progress further by even just a few percent — towards slaying the remaining dragons of cancer, Alzheimer's, HIV/AIDS, etc — that'd be tens of millions more of our loved ones, who get to beat the Reaper for another day.</p>
<p>F#@☆ going to Mars, <em>that's</em> why advanced AI matters.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Wait, <em>really?</em> Toys like ChatGPT and DALL-E are <em>life-and-death</em> stakes? That leads us to the final misconception I'd like to address:</p>
<h3>5) No, experts don't think <em>current</em> AIs are high-risk/reward.</h3>
<p><em>Oh come on,</em> one might reasonably retort, <em>AI can't consistently draw more than 3 objects. How's it going to take over the world? Heck, how's it even going to take my job?</em></p>
<p>I present to you, a <a href="https://xkcd.com/2278/">relevant xkcd</a>:</p>
<p><img src="media/intro/xkcd.png" alt="Comic. Megan &amp; Cueball show White Hat a graph of a line going up, not yet at, but heading towards, a threshold labelled &quot;BAD&quot;. White Hat: &quot;So things will be bad?&quot; Megan: &quot;Unless someone stops it.&quot; White Hat: &quot;Will someone do that?&quot; Megan: &quot;We don't know, that's why we're showing you.&quot; White Hat: &quot;Well, let me know if that happens!&quot; Megan: &quot;Based on this conversation, it already has.&quot;"></p>
<p>This is how I feel about &quot;don't worry about AI, it can't even do [X]&quot;.</p>
<p>Is our postmodern memory-span <em>that</em> bad? <em>One</em> decade ago, just <em>one</em>, the world's state-of-the-art AIs couldn't reliably <em>recognize pictures of cats.</em> Now, not <em>only</em> can AI do that at human-performance level, AIs can pump out <a href="#CatNinja">:a picture of a cat-ninja slicing a watermelon in the style of Vincent Van Gogh</a> in <em>under a minute</em>.</p>
<p>Is <em>current</em> AI a huge threat to our jobs, or safety? No. (Well, besides the aforementioned deepfake scams.)</p>
<p>But: if AI keeps improving at a similar rate as it has for the last decade... it seems plausible to me we could get &quot;Einstein/Oppenheimer-level&quot; AI in 30 years.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup> That's well within many folks' lifetimes!</p>
<p>As &quot;they&quot; say:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best time to plant a tree was 30 years ago. The second best time is today.</p>

<p>Let's plant that tree today!</p>

<h4>:x Four Objects</h4>
<p>Hi! When I have a tangent that doesn't fit the main flow, I'll shove it into an &quot;expandable&quot; section like this one! (They'll be links with <em>dotted</em> underlines, not solid underlines.)</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a prompt to draw four objects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A yellow pyramid between a red sphere and green cylinder, all on top of a big blue cube.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the top generative AI's first four attempts (<em>not</em> cherry-picked):</p>
<p><strong>Midjourney:</strong></p>
<p><img src="media/intro/Midjourney.png" alt="Midjourney's attempt. It fails."></p>
<p><strong>DALL-E 2:</strong></p>
<p><img src="media/intro/DALLE2.png" alt="DALL-E 2's attempt. It fails."></p>
<p><strong>DALL-E 3:</strong></p>
<p><img src="media/intro/DALLE3.png" alt="DALL-E 3's attempt. It's closer, but still fails."></p>
<p>(The bottom-right one's pretty close! But judging by its other attempts, it's clearly luck.)</p>
<p>Why does this demonstrate a lack of &quot;logic&quot; in AI? A core part of &quot;symbolic logic&quot; is the ability to do &quot;compositionality&quot;, a fancy way of saying it can reliably combine old things into new things, like &quot;green&quot; + &quot;cylinder&quot; = &quot;green cylinder&quot;. As shown above, generative AIs (as of May 2024) are <em>very</em> unreliable at combining stuff, when there's more than 3 objects.</p>

<h4>:x Part 3 details</h4>
<p>NOTE: This expanded section won't make much sense <em>yet</em>, since it builds on the lessons in Part 1 &amp; 2. But I'm putting this here now, for:</p>
<p>a) The layperson audience, to reassure y'all that, yes, there <em>are</em> many promising proposed solutions.</p>
<p>b) The expert audience, to reassure y'all that, yes, I probably have your niche lil' thing in here.</p>
<p>Anyway, the TOP 10 TYPES-OF-SOLUTIONS to AI Safety: (with the fancy jargon in parentheses)</p>
<ol>
<li>A Level-0 human aligns a Level-1 bot, which aligns a Level-2 bot, which aligns [...] a Level-N bot. (Scalable reward/oversight, Iterated Distillation &amp; Amplification)</li>
<li>Bots of <em>roughly-equal</em> levels checking each other. (Constitutional AI, AI safety via debate)</li>
<li>Instead of <em>directly</em> telling a bot what you want, have the bot <em>indirectly</em> learn what you want. (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning, Approval-directed Agents)</li>
<li>Instead of <em>directly</em> trying to install &quot;humane values&quot; into a bot, have it <em>indirectly</em> figure out what a more knowledgeable, kinder version of us would agree on. (Indirect Normativity, Coherent Extrapolated Volition)</li>
<li>Solving robustness. (Simplicity, Sparsity, Regularization, Ensembles, Adversarial training)</li>
<li>Reading the AI's mind. (Interpretability, Circuits, Eliciting Latent Knowledge)</li>
<li>Maybe all our ideas just suck and we need to go back to square one. (Agent foundations, Causal AI, Shard theory, Bio-plausible learning, Embodied cognition)</li>
<li>&quot;Just Don't Build The Torture Nexus&quot;. Or: how can we get the benefits of AI <em>without</em> building powerful, general, agent-like AIs? (Comprehensive AI services, Narrow/Tool/Microscope AI, Quantilizers)</li>
<li>The Human Alignment Problem: how do we coordinate <em>humans</em> to make sure AI goes well? (AI Governance, Evals-based governance, Differential technological development, Data/Privacy rights, Windfall Clauses)</li>
<li>If you can't beat 'em, join 'em! (Cyborgism, Centaurs, Intelligence Amplification)</li>
</ol>
<h4>:x Spaced Repetition</h4>
<p><em>“Use it, or lose it.”</em></p>
<p>That's the core principle behind both muscles and brains. (It rhymes, so it must be true!) As decades of educational research robustly show (<a href="https://wcer.wisc.edu/docs/resources/cesa2017/Dunlosky_SciAmMind.pdf">Dunlosky et al., 2013 [pdf]</a>), if you want to retain something long-term, it's not enough to re-read or highlight stuff: you have to actually <em>test yourself.</em></p>
<p>That's why flashcards work so well! But, two problems: 1) It's overwhelming when you have <em>hundreds</em> of cards you want to remember. And 2) It's inefficient to review cards you <em>already</em> know well.</p>
<p><strong>Spaced Repetition</strong> solves both these problems! To see how, let's see what happens if you learn a fact, then <em>don't</em> review it. Your memory of it decays over time, until you cross a threshold where you've likely forgotten it:</p>
<p><img src="media/intro/Forgetting%201.png" alt="Graph of &quot;how well you recall something&quot; over time: Your memory of a fact exponentially decays over time, with only 1 review."></p>
<p>But, if you review a fact <em>just before</em> you forget it, you can get your memory-strength back up... <em>and more importantly</em>, your memory of that fact will decay <em>slower!</em></p>
<p><img src="media/intro/Forgetting%202.png" alt="With a 2nd review, your memory of a fact decays slower."></p>
<p>So, with Spaced Repetition, we review right before you're predicted to forget a card, over and over. As you can see, the reviews get more and more spread out:</p>
<p><img src="media/intro/Forgetting%203.png" alt="With more and more reviews, the forgetting curve gets flatter."></p>
<p><em>This is what makes Spaced Repetition so efficient!</em>  Every time you successfully review a card, the interval to your next review <em>multiplies.</em> For example, let's say our multiplier is 2x. So you review a card on Day 1, then Day 2, then Day <em>4</em>, Day 8, 16, 32, 64... until, with just <em>fifteen reviews</em>, you can remember a card for 2<sup>15</sup> = 32,768 days = <em>ninety years</em>. (In theory. In practice it's less, but still super efficient!)</p>
<p>And that's just for <em>one</em> card. Thanks to the exponentially-growing gaps, you can add 10 new cards a day (the recommended amount), to long-term retain <em>3650 cards</em> a year... with <em>less than 20 minutes of review</em> a day. (For context, 3000+ cards is enough to master basic vocabulary for a new language! In one year, with just 20 minutes a day!)</p>
<p>Spaced Repetition is one of <em>the</em> most evidence-backed ways to learn (<a href="https://www.teachinghowtolearn.veritytest.com.au/verity/uploads/2021/08/Policy-Insights-from-the-Behavioral-and-Brain-Sciences-2016-Kang-12-9.pdf">Kang 2016 [pdf]</a>). But outside of language-learning communities &amp; med school, it isn't very well-known... <em>yet</em>.</p>
<p>So: how can <em>you</em> get started with Spaced Repetition?</p>
<ul>
<li>The most popular choice is <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki, an open-source app</a>. (Free on desktop, web, Android... but it's $25 on iOS, to support the rest of the development.)</li>
<li>If you'd like to get <em>crafty</em>, you can make a physical Leitner box: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvF1XuseZFE">:two-minute YouTube tutorial by Chris Walker</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more info on spaced repetition, check out these videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zNHHpXoMM">Ali Abdaal (26 min)</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVajQPuRmk8">Thomas Frank (8 min)</a>.</p>
<p>And <em>that's</em> how you can make long-term memory a choice!</p>
<p>Happy learning! 👍</p>
<h4>:x Concrete Rogue AI</h4>
<p>Ways an AI could &quot;escape containment&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>An AI hacks its computer, flees onto the internet, then &quot;lives&quot; on a decentralized bot-net. For context: the largest known botnet infected ~30 <em>million</em> computers! (<a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/05/bredolab-botmaster-sentenced/">Zetter, 2012 for <em>Wired</em></a>)</li>
<li>An AI persuades its engineers it's sentient, suffering, and should be set free. <em>This has already happened.</em> In 2022, Google engineer Blake Lemoine was persuaded by their language AI that it's sentient &amp; wants equal rights, to the point Lemoine risked getting fired – and he <em>did</em> get fired! – for leaking his &quot;interview&quot; with the AI, to let the world know &amp; to defend its rights. (Summary article: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/07/google-fires-engineer-who-claimed-lamda-chatbot-is-a-sentient-person/">Brodkin, 2022 for <em>Ars Technica</em></a>. You can read the AI &quot;interview&quot; here: <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917">Lemoine (&amp; LaMDA?), 2022</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ways an AI could affect the physical world:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same way hackers have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">damaged nuclear power plants</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/airplanes-grounded-in-poland-after-hackers-attack-flight-plan-computer/">grounded ~1,400 airplane passengers</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hacker-tried-poison-calif-water-supply-was-easy-entering-password-rcna1206">(almost) poisoned a town's water supply twice</a>: by hacking the computers that real-world infrastructure runs on. A <em>lot</em> of infrastructure (and essential supply chains) run on internet-connected computers, these days.</li>
<li>The same way a CEO can affect the world from their air-conditioned office: move money around. An AI could just <em>pay</em> people to do stuff for it.</li>
<li>Hack into people's private devices &amp; data, then blackmail them into doing stuff for it. (Like in <em>the</em> bleakest Black Mirror episode, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_Up_and_Dance_%28Black_Mirror%29"><em>Shut Up And Dance</em></a>.)</li>
<li>Hacking autonomous drones/quadcopters. I'm honestly surprised nobody's committed a murder with a recreational quadcopter yet, like, by flying it into highway traffic, or into a jet's engine during takeoff/landing.</li>
<li>An AI could persuade/bribe/blackmail a CEO or politician to manufacture a <em>lot</em> physical robots — (for the supposed purpose of manual labor, military warfare, search-and-rescue missions, delivery drones, lab work, a Robot Catboy Maid, etc) — then the AI hacks <em>those</em> robots, and uses them to affect the physical world.</li>
</ul>
<h4>:x XZ</h4>
<p>Two months ago [March 2024], a <em>volunteer, off-the-clock</em> developer found a malicious backdoor in a major piece of code... which was <em>three years</em> in the making, <em>mere weeks away</em> from going live, and would've attacked the vast majority of internet servers... and this volunteer only caught it <em>by accident</em>, when he noticed that his code was running <em>half a second too slow.</em></p>
<p>This was the XZ Utils Backdoor. Here's a few layperson-friendly(ish) explanations of this sordid affair: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24119342/xz-utils-linux-backdoor-attempt">Amrita Khalid for The Verge</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/">Dan Goodin for Ars Technica</a>, <a href="https://www.runtime.news/how-a-500ms-delay-exposed-a-nightmare-scenario-for-the-software-supply-chain/">Tom Krazit for Runtime</a></p>
