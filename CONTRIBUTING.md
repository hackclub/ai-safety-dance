## How to contribute

Found inaccuracies? Make an Issue! Then (time & spoons permitting) I'll figure out what if anything to do about it, and how to re-write.

Found a typo / weird phrasing / dead or incorrect links? Also make an Issue! But if you want to be more direct, you can also make a Pull Request.

Also, the Moore/more mix-ups in Part One aren't typos, they're... [checks notes]... "jokes".

## How to translate

Oh god there is *no* easy way to translate this 20,000-word thing. I am so sorry.

First, FORK AND MAKE YOUR OWN REPO for any translations. There is no way in heck any of that will fit easily in here. Here's what to translate:

* The words: Translate the Markdowns
* The webpages: Translate the relevant words in `templates/page_template.html` and in `build.js`
* The images: Use your image editor of choice to edit the words in the images in `media`. Peruse Google Fonts for a good replacement font.

## The janky-as-heck "build process"

Don't exit the .html files directly. Instead, make edits to the Markdowns:

* Introduction is at `intro.md`
* Part One is at `p1/p1.md`
* and so on

To build them into a static site, `npm run build`. This will write your updates to the html files (`index.html`, `p1/index.html`, etc.)

(There's also another build script in `anki/all-orbits-to-anki.js` that converts all the Orbit flashcards in the above markdowns into .txt files that you can then import into Anki. You, dear contributor, probably won't personally need this.)
